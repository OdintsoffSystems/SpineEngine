# SpineEngine

Simple (and Old) game engine made with pure Java. Abandoned in 2013. 

It was the base for most of my projects during that time. Some of them moved to libGDX.
Originally built in NetBeans (project files included but not sure if still runs in newer versions).

Some sample projects using it included in the **examples** folder.

## Dev Notes

2023-05-09 - I swear it had OGG sound support at some time, I will try to find this code.
